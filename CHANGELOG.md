# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.11] - 2026-03-20

### Highlights

- **Second external contribution!** Welcome @shubham-lohiya, who exposed the `Bash` class with Monty Python execution and external function handler in the Python bindings ([#760](https://github.com/everruns/bashkit/pull/760)) — making it easy to extend bashkit with custom Python functions
- **Browser terminal example**: Bashkit now runs entirely in the browser via WebAssembly (`wasm32-wasip1-threads`), with a single-file terminal UI — no framework required
- **New features**: structured execution trace events, per-instance memory budgets, static AST budget validation, `head -c` byte mode, IFS separator + `$_` tracking, final environment state in `ExecResult`
- **Security hardening**: blackbox security audit surfaced 15 vulnerabilities — all fixed; readonly variable bypass blocked; stack overflow, memory exhaustion, and source recursion depth limits enforced; shell injection prevented in JS VFS helpers
- **Major refactoring**: FileSystem split into core + FileSystemExt, shared ArgParser extracted, register_builtins! macro replacing 120+ insert calls, ShellRef Context API, shell options split-brain fix
