# 012: Pre-Release Maintenance

## Status
Implemented

## Abstract

Requirements for pre-release maintenance. Ensures no regressions, stale docs,
dependency rot, or security gaps ship in a release.

## When to Run

- Before every minor or major release
- Quarterly for patch-only periods
- After large feature merges

## Requirements

### Dependencies

- All direct dependencies at latest compatible versions
- No known CVEs in dependency tree
- License and advisory checks pass (`deny.toml`)
- Supply chain audit passes
- Major version bumps evaluated and upgraded where safe

### Security

- Threat model (`specs/006-threat-model.md`) covers all current features
- Public threat model doc (`crates/bashkit/docs/threat-model.md`) in sync with spec
- Every new builtin/feature has a corresponding TM-XXX entry
- Security tests exist for every MITIGATED threat
- Failpoint tests pass
- Unsafe usage reviewed (`cargo geiger`)
- No OWASP-style issues (injection, path traversal, etc.)

### Tests

- All tests pass
- No test gaps for recently added features
- Test counts in `009-implementation-status.md` match reality
- Bash compatibility — no new regressions against real bash
- Coverage reviewed — no major uncovered paths

### Documentation

- Rust crate docs (`lib.rs`) match reality: command count, categories, guide list, features, examples
- Guide docs (`crates/bashkit/docs/`) up to date: compatibility, threat-model, custom_builtins, logging, python
- Rustdoc builds clean (no warnings)
- Python docs (`crates/bashkit-python/README.md`) match current bindings and exports
- Python docstrings match behavior
- `README.md` feature list matches implemented builtins
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` instructions accurate
- `CHANGELOG.md` has entries for all changes since last release

### Examples

- All Rust examples compile and run
- Feature-gated examples work (python, git)
- Python agent examples run end-to-end
- Code examples in docs/rustdoc still accurate

### Specs

- Each spec status reflects reality
- `009-implementation-status.md` feature tables match code
- No orphaned TODOs in specs that are now resolved
- New features have spec entries

### Code Quality

- Formatted (`cargo fmt`)
- No clippy warnings
- No stale TODO/WTF comments that are now resolved
- No dead code or unused dependencies

### Code Simplification

- Duplicated patterns consolidated into shared helpers where it reduces total code
- Unnecessary abstractions, indirection, or over-engineering removed
- Complex nested logic simplified (deep nesting, long match arms)
- Dead code removed (unused functions, unreachable branches, commented-out code)
- Names are clear and descriptive (functions, variables, types)
- No premature generalizations — code serves current needs, not hypothetical future ones

### Agent Configuration

- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` instructions accurate
- Spec table in `AGENTS.md` lists all current specs
- Build/test commands work
- Pre-PR checklist covers current tooling

### Nightly CI

- Nightly and fuzz workflows green for past week
- Fuzz targets compile
- Git-sourced dependencies still resolve

#### Nightly Escalation Policy

Failures persisting **>2 consecutive days** are blocking:
1. Open GitHub issue with label `ci:nightly`
2. Link failing run(s)
3. Assign to most recent contributor in failing area
4. If upstream dep change: pin to known-good rev, open follow-up issue

## Automation

Sections dependencies, tests, examples, code quality, and nightly CI are fully
automatable. Security, documentation, specs, simplification, and agent config
require human or agent review.

Nightly check enforced by `just check-nightly`, called by `just release-check`.

## Invocation

Use `/maintain` skill to execute this checklist interactively.
